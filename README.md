# Medical Expert System

## üìù Project Description

This project is a small ** Medical Expert System ** designed to assist in diagnosing common illnesses based on symptoms presented by patients. The system uses a knowledge base of medical rules and employs backward chaining inference to offer basic diagnoses to users.

## üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Problem Formulation

Medical diagnosis often requires considering multiple symptoms to accurately identify potential illnesses. This system addresses this complexity by utilizing the following components:

- **Knowledge Base**: A repository of medical rules linking symptoms to specific illnesses.
- **Inference Engine**: Backward chaining inference to analyze user-provided symptoms and deduce potential illnesses.
- **User Interface**: A simple, user-friendly PyQt5-based interface for users to input symptoms and receive diagnosis reports.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **UI Framework**: PyQt5
- **Inference Technique**: Backward Chaining (AIMA framework)
- **Knowledge Representation**: First-Order Logic (FOL)
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source code management
